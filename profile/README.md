# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and Welcome to GuineaBot3Labs!

GuineaBot3Labs is a collaborative, innovative space where passionate individuals come together to work on cutting-edge projects in programming, ethical hacking, and AI development. Our primary goal is to make the world a better place through technology, fostering an environment of learning and growth.

## Our Vision

Our vision is to make projects that will have a lasting positive impact on the world, while including STEM into this serious process, so that individuals can learn while they create.

### Current Projects:

- **GuineaBOT**: An advanced Chess AI designed to learn and adapt. We're constantly seeking ways to improve its learning algorithms and performance.
- **StarFox-AI**: An advanced Convolutional Neural Network tasked with playing StarFox, in hopes of learning more about computer vision and spatial awareness in AI. (postponed)
- **higan-env**: A modification of the emulator [higan][higan-link] that includes an API for interfacing programs with emulators.
