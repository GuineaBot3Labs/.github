# Welcome to GuineaBot3Labs

GuineaBot3Labs is a volunteer-driven collective focused on advancing programming, ethical hacking, and artificial intelligence. Our community leverages our members' diverse expertise and passion to develop technology with a positive societal impact.

Please note the README is going through many changes, don't be suprised if the README changes drastically in the future.

## Our Mission

We are committed to creating a supportive environment where individuals can collaborate on innovative projects. Our aim is to blend learning with development, empowering our members to grow their skills while contributing to meaningful technological advancements.

### Our Projects

- **GuineaBot3 (Status: Complete)**: An advanced Chess AI designed for continuous learning and adaptation, yep, that's about it...
- **StarFox-AI (Status: Dormant)**: A advanced Convolutional Neural Network tasked with playing StarFox on higan to learn about computer vision and how neural networks percieve their environment. Currently paused due to the development of higan-env, which will power StarFox-AI in the future.
- **higan-env (Status: In development)**: A modification of the higan emulator, bridges the gap between AI, training environments, and classic games; so researchers and learners can train models to do many tasks. higan-env is very a similar project to OpenAI's [Gym-Retro](https://github.com/openai/retro) in the way it interfaces with higan.
